[h1]This mod makes possible assigning of building themes citywide or per district[/h1]

What this mod does:
* Adds 'Themes' tab to districts policies panel
* Filters buildings in districts by districts' active themes.
* Provides two built-in themes, 'European' and 'International'
* Stores building themes in an XML file ({Steam folder}\steamapps\common\Cities_Skylines\BuildingThemes.xml)
* Allows adding custom themes and extending built-in themes via the XML configuration file (Later this will be possible with UI - see 'Upcoming features' section)
* Saves district data in XML files for each saved game (buildingThemesSave_{ID}.xml). They can be found in {Steam folder}\steamapps\common\Cities_Skylines\Cities_Data. Cloud saves supported too. To clear themes assignment just delete those files.

Use 'Themes' tab to enable or disable district's themes. You can specify any number of active themes. If no theme is active for district it will mean that any growable is allowed.
Biome's native theme will be active by default('European' for 'European' biome and 'International' for 'Boreal', 'Temperate' or 'Tropical')
Themes specified city-wide will be applied to each new district you add automatically.
If you redraw district's borders the buildings not belonging to district's theme won't disappear. When it's time for them to levelup they will levelup to theme's buildings.

What this mod doesn't do:
* It won't corrupt your save games if you disable it
* It doesn't unlock European growables for non-European biomes or vice versa. Use [b]European Buildings Unlocker[/b] for that.

Upcoming features:
* Building Themes Manager UI

This mod should be 100% compatible with all other mods. If it's not just tell us.
